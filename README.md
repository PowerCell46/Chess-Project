# Chess Project
This is my best project as of now. **I have spent more than 50 hours writing it**.
### It's a **Game of Chess** written in Python that you can play either with another player either with Chat Gpt. It's **over 2200** lines of pure code. It can be played on the console or in a small external window.
With this project I have shown my ability to **write clean, easily-extensible and maintainable code**, working with various Python libraries such as: **colorama**, **pyfiglet**, **time**, **webbrowser**, **tkinter** and **openai**. You can see that I have structured my code pretty well in a large amount of **functions**, can work with **abstract code**, work with **dictionaries**, write **complex algorithms**, use **error an file handling** and can use **Chat Gpt's API**.
